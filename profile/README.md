## Welcome to the Billmann Lab

We explore how genes interact in networks to regulate cells. We are particularly interested to learn how such functional interactions respond to environmental changes and how this functional flexibility is impacted by disease-associated genetic variants. To this end, we develop computational methods to infer mechanistic cues from functional genomics data such as large compendia of CRISPR screens and tissue type-resolved expression atlases.
